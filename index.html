    Hey, hi, hello! My name is Gabbi. I am currently a graduate student in Stanford University's Department of Computer Science, and my studies concern systems and network security. I love to geek out over network infrastructure, applied cryptography, and operating systems, in addition to technology and security policy. 
    <br><br>
    I also love teaching. I've previously TA-ed Stanford's Introduction to Computer Systems and Introduction to Computer Networks courses. Despite my baby face, I also got to <a href="fixtures/pdfs/gcc_make_up6.pdf">teach a lecture once</a>.
    <br><br>
    You're welcome to peek at my <a href="fixtures/pdfs/fisher_resume.pdf">resume</a> if you want to learn more about my engineering background.
    <br><br>
    In August 2018 I'm thrilled to join Cloudflare as a Cryptography Engineer!
