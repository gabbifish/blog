Hey, hi, hello! My name is Gabbi. I'm a systems engineer on the [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) team. Before that, I received my Master's Degree from Stanford University's Department of Computer Science, where my studies concerned systems and network security. I love to geek out over network infrastructure, applied cryptography, and operating systems, in addition to technology and security policy.

I also love teaching. I've previously TA-ed Stanford's Introduction to Computer Systems and Introduction to Computer Networks courses. Despite my baby face, I've also taught some lectures, like [this fun one](/pdfs/gcc_make_up6.pdf) on the fundamentals of gcc and the Unix Executable and Linkable Format.

When I'm not in front of a computer, you'll likely find me in the wilderness. A fun photo from the Goat Rocks Wilderness, July 2018:
